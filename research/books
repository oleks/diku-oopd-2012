not a children's book


Java for everyone -- Cay Horstmann
- looks like a children's book
- not particularly happy about code highlighting
+ explanations of the code with important things highlighted
- main introduced with forward links


A concise survey of computer methods - Peter Naur

p.10:

Indeed, the student should be encouraged to use the original literature, both
in order to benefit from the wider horizon covered by the combined outlooks of
many authors, and in order to practise the mode of work that is required to
keep abreast of new developments.


p.11:

By extension I decided that "datalogy" would be a suitable term for "the
science of data and data processes". To this my collegues Paul Lindgreen and
Per Brinch Hansen added "datamatics" to denote "automatic data processing" and
"datamaton" to denote "computer".

p.21:

The difference is that when we talk of a process we are interested in how it is
done, usually by several work stages, while in a transformation we look at the
data going in and data coming out and their mutual relation without bothering
about precisely how the change was effected... Two processes which realize the
same transformation will be termed equivalent.

  - a pretty neat example of the sum of numbers and various processes possible
    for achieving the sum transoformation.

p. 23:

This freedom in the choice of phenomenon to use as the data representation of a
given fact or idea or more briefly, the freedom in the choice of data
representation, reflects deeply into datalogy.

  - contrasts static/dynamic data, analog/digital, digital being a finite
    sequence of letters from a finite alphabet.


p. 66:

Large programs should always be developed as a number of subprograms that are
subsequently combined. This is important as a way for the designer to remain
the master of the situation. The subprograms should be tested separately,
before being combined, with the aid of specially written testprograms This
cannot solve all the problems of testing since the interfaces between the
subprograms may yet contain errors. Still the advantage of achieving some
degree of division of the testing problem into more managable parts should
exploited whenever possible.

  - neat, but modern compilers provide ways to ensure interface consistency,
    leaving the subprogram tests to test their own full compliance with the
    interfaces. Among the problems at hand are things like x should be >= 10,
    which is not representable by a type. Note the relation to C.A.R. Hoare
    assertions.
