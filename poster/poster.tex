We invite you to participate in a {\bf free dry run} of the course in the month
of July, 2012.

\vspace{0.2in}

The initial plan is to dry run the course online. The educational material will
be made available in wiki form, and you will be asked to hand in weekly
assignments electronically. These assignments will be subject to automated
testing and be qualitatively reviewed by the instructors. For your convenience,
we'll provide a disucssion forum where you can discuss the material with the
instructors and your peers. Depending on the participant quantity we might
provide unofficial lectures at DIKU as well.

There is no credit entailed in taking this {\bf free} course.
