Consider doing the laundry. If we have a common, house-hold washing machine at
our disposal; the {\it procedure} may look something like this:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Split into colors and whites.

\item Wash whites.

\item Wash colors.

\item Dry the laundry.

\item Neatly pile up the laundry.

\end{enumerate}

In a functional programming language, e.g. SML, this may end up looking like
this:

pile(map dry (map wash (split laundry)))

While comprehensible, the program does not really read well. In English, we
read left-to-right, top-to-bottom; here we read right-to-left and there is no
concept of top-to-bottom at all.
