\section{Imperative programming}

An alternative programming paradigm, the \key{imperative}, is historically
closer to hardware. It emerged as the programming paradigm for computer
architectures stemming from John von Neumann's original proposal for the design
of the digital computer\cite{von-neumann}.  A key aspect of the von Neumann
architecture is that it keeps the computer rather feebleminded, forcing the
programmer to be the clever one.  Inevitably, no good introduction to the
imperative programming paradigm can commence, without at least a gentle
introduction to the von Neumann architecture.
