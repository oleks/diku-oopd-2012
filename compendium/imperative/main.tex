\vspace{0.5in}

What you've been practising thus far, is mostly the \key{declarative}
programming paradigm.

\begin{definition}

In a purely declarative programming paradigm, values are \key{immutable}, and
programming is done by describing the relationships between values using
\key{functions}.

\end{definition}

Less formally, in pure declarative programming, we avoid describing the
\key{flow} of the program and resort to pure function application, or rather,
function application is the only connective we've got.  In this paradigm, the
programmer is concerned with the mapping of input values to output values, such
that the mapping defines a \key{class of computations} that the program can
evoke.  The programmer is less concerned with being particularly clear about
the flow of data or control throughout the program, as this is implicit in the
mapping.

As you may have already noticed, this paradigm can be notoriously difficult to
apply to certain problems, despite (or due to) it's neat mathematical
properties.  What's more, the more accurate student would've already noticed
that you've not done \emph{pure} declarative programming, but rather, already
have experience with a few \key{control flow structures} such as \key{if-} and
\key{case-} \key{statements}\marginExercise{cfsahof}.  Why this is, will become
apparent shortly. We will return to these, and many more control flow
structures, in a bit as well.

An alternative programming paradigm, the \key{imperative}, is historically
closer to hardware. It emerged as the programming paradigm for computer
architectures stemming from John von Neumann's original proposal for the design
of the digital computer\cite{von-neumann}.  The von Neumann architecture leaves
the computer rather feebleminded, and hence, it is the programmer that has to
be the clever one when specifying the program to evoke.

A good explanation of the imperative paradigm calls for a gentle introduction
to the von Neumann architecture, at least in some general sense.

\begin{definition}

A \key{computer} is an entity with \key{state} and a series of
\key{processors}.  Processors perform \key{actions} that change the state of
the computer.

\end{definition}

We conventionally use the words ``\key{machine}'' and ``\key{system}''
interchangeably with the word ``computer''.

While it may be modern (about time) to speak of computers as having multiple
processors, we will restrain ourselves to uniprocessor machines. Sometimes it
will provide for an interesting discussion to consider multiprocessor machines,
but in such cases they will be mentioned explicitly.

\begin{definition}

``An action is a happening, taking place in a finite period of time and
establishing a well-defined, intended \key{net-effect}.''
\cite{dijkstra-introduction}

\end{definition}

This definition highlights two important points. Firstly, an action takes place
in a finite period of time, say $T_1$. This allows for us to speak of a point
in time $T_n$ and $T_{n+1}$, as the time of action inception and termination,
respectively. In particular, such that $T_{n+1}=T_n+T_1$. Secondly, an action
establishes a well-defined, intended net-effect. This highlights that we are
interested in deterministic actions that change the state of the computer.

To this end, it makes sense to describe the ``net-effect'' of an action as the
difference between the state of the computer at time $T_n$ and $T_{n+1}$.
However, this notion breaks down as we turn to multiprocessor machines where
the clear benefit of performing multiple actions at once has been utilized.
Therefore, apply this notion with care. We will discuss the notion of ``state''
in depth in a latter section.

% brewing coffee (perhaps too few instructions)
% going to work (boring instructions)
% elevator (example of coroutines by Knuth)
% doing the dishes
% preparing dinner
% making tea (too few operations)
% following a recipe 
% solving a second degree equation

% As an example of an action, let us consider the taming of a craving for a New
% York Cheesecake\footnote{A lot of potential cheesecakes were harmed in the
% preparation of this example.}, which we'll refer to simply as ``cheesecake''.
% Hence, at point $T_n$, you have a craving for a cheesecake, and at point
% $T_{n+1}$, that craving has already been tamed.

% Rather intuitively, we can come up with a general sequence of sub-actions for
% this action. For instance, we have to \begin{inparaenum}[(1)] \item find a
% recipe for the cheesecake, \item gather ingredients for the cheesecake, and
% \item actually prepare and bake the cheesecake\end{inparaenum}. It is also
% intuitively clear that it is important that these sub-actions occur in this
% particular order, otherwise we'll almost surely end up with a different
% net-effect than originally intended.

% What's less clear, but equally as important is that there are other options to
% taming this craving. For instance, we could go down to the local bakery or
% coffee shop and pay for a ready-made piece of the delicacy. Alternatively, if
% we're billionaires, we might catch a flight to New York and get a piece of the
% ``real'' New York Cheesecake.

% All of these possibilities have their pros and cons. For instance, the home
% made solution is probably the cheapest, and gives you the best options to cater
% the delicacy as you wish, however it requires considerable effort on your side,
% and it takes a considerable amount of time. The local bakery solution is
% probably the quickest, yet probably not the cheapest, and gives you rather few
% catering choices. The last solution is the most expensive, the lengthiest, but
% according to some people may be the most pleasant.

% Depending on the context in which we're referring to the action, it may be
% beneficial to regard it as either an action or this sequence of actions, i.e.
% sub-actions. What's more, the sub-actions themselves can be further broken down
% into their respective sub-actions, recursively. For instance, if we're hungry 

As an example of an action let us consider solving second degree equations of
the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.  This is done using the well-known formula:

$${-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta} \over 2a}.$$

Where $\Delta$ is commonly known as the discriminant and is defined as follows:

$$ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac.$$

\newpage

The reason this benefit is ``clear'' comes up when we discuss the notion of
state. We can define the state of a computer as a sequence $S$, of
equally-sized chunks, called \key{words}. The processor is historically only
capable of performing actions on a fixed number of such words at a time.
Usually, this number is \emph{much} smaller than the length of $S$. As a matter
of fact, it is often theoretically beneficial to let $S$ be infinite in size.

For instance, it is not uncommon for a processor to be capable of adding two
numbers together, but it is uncommon for it to be able to perform a summation
of an arbitrary sequence of numbers. If one wishes to perform such a summation,
one must resort to iterated application of the aforementioned binary addition. 

You can imagine the processor in a uniprocessor computer as a lonely librarian
in a long one-dimensional tape library. To comply with our present notion of
state, let the library consist of equally-sized tapes arranged in a linear
fashion. The consequent location of the tapes along the single library
dimension superimposes an \key{address} for every tape relative to some
reference tape. In particular, although the number of tapes can often be left
unspecified, there should always be a discrete finite number of tapes between
any chosen pair of tapes in the library.

The librarian walks atop these tapes, and is so fat that he occupies exactly
the size of one tape. The librarian also has some eye problems, and is
therefore only capable of observing the tape directly below him. Hence, the
librarian is unable to observe multiple randomly distributed tapes
simultaneously. However, like any human, the librarian has a fairly limited
short term memory, but can never-the-less remember a few things at once.
Therefore, he can keep a few tapes in memory while he travels to the other
tapes to observe their values. Once all the values for a particular action are
in his short term memory, the librarian can perform the action and place the
results back in his short term memory.

If the librarian is not going to use the results in the foreseeable future, it
is probably best to write them down somewhere. The only way for the librarian
to do this is to overwrite some library tapes and keep the results there until
they are needed again. This frees up the rather meager short term memory of the
librarian for the performance of other actions.

If we had to hence describe the essential constituents an action, we'd say that
in the time frame $T_1$, the librarian should be able to
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)] \item observe a fixed number of tapes, \item perform an
action with those tapes in his short-term memory, and \item overwrite a fixed
number of tapes with the results\end{inparaenum}.

It is important to reiterate that this sequence of the ``sub-actions'' has to
happen in the fixed time frame of $T_1$, in particular, such that
$T_n+T_1=T_{n+1}$.  This means that regardless of the locations of the tapes in
question, the action must take at most time $T_1$. Yet, the librarian has to
move about in order to observe and overwrite, i.e. to \key{access} various
tapes. In the worst case, the tapes of interest may be at opposite ends of the
(finite) library.  Therefore, the larger the library, the larger the $T_1$ has
to be. 

Instead of letting our concept of time vary on the length of our library, or on
the spatial discontinuity of our actions, we usually take a leap of faith and
let our state $S$ possess a property known as \key{random access}.

\begin{definition}

A sequence with random access, allows for any element of the sequence to
retrieved in equal time, regardless of the sequence size.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}

A state $S$ is a sequence of equally sized chunks with random access.

\end{definition}

In general, we will refer to any finite-size sequence with consequent element
addressing and random access as an \key{array}. Therefore, any state of a
computer that is finite in size is an array. It is common to refer to the state
of a computer as it's \key{memory} (not to be confused with the short term
memory), and we shall no longer diverge from that jargon.

You can contrast random access to e.g. \key{sequential access}, where elements
further along in the sequence require longer time to retrieve. In a way, this
is akin to giving our librarian teleporting abilities, but really we're just
trusting for an access to a random library tape to be nonessential to the time
frame $T_1$. 

This allows for $T_1$ to be constrained to \begin{inparaenum}[(1)] \item the
number of tapes the librarian needs to perform an action, \item the time it
takes to actually perform the action, and \item the number of tapes that need
to be overwritten as a result of the action\end{inparaenum}. Clearly, much of
this is constrained by the short term memory of the librarian.  Yet, for all
actions, the same restrictive short term memory is used.  Therefore, so long as
the time that it takes to perform an action does not vary considerably from
action to action, the time frame $T_1$ can be regarded as a basic unit of time
for all further time analyses of programs executed on this computer. 

% If we desired a precise estimate of the running time of a program on some
% particular computer, and we had such an abstract analysis at hand, we'd be a
% constant multiplication factor away from the solution. It is practical to
% perform analysis of the running time and space requirements in this manner,
% since they facilitate an analysis of the program regardless of the precise
% details of the underlying architecture.

There's quite a few leaps of faith that we've taken here, and they are worth a
deeper afterthought. First off, we trust for the hardware of the computer to
function properly. For instance, although the librarian has a small short term
memory, we expect him to remember those few tapes par excellence. What's more,
we expect for the tape observations and overwrites to lossless, and so on.

If one is familiar with basic electronics this may seem like quite a leap of
faith to make. However, separation of concerns is an important aspect in the
programmer's profession if she is to remain productive. It has therefore become
conventional for the programmer to assume the correct functioning of a lot of
hardware elements, leaving it to the electrical engineers to make sure that the
assumptions are (almost surely) sound.

On the other hand we've taken the leap of faith that the time frame of an
action does not vary much from action to action, such that it is not completely
absurd to measure the running time of a program by using an action as the basic
unit of time. Interestingly, this does not have to be the case. The intent of
this is to provide means to analyze programs regardless of the actual
architecture on which the program may be run, to a certain extent of course.
Indeed, practice shows that the most popular programs run on a variety of
different computers, varying in the size of memory, speed of the processor,
etc.

Another leap of faith that we've taken is that while some tapes are in short
term memory, the actual tapes in the computer's memory are not overwritten with
new data, i.e. we've assumed that an action is \key{atomic} wrt. the state of
the computer. If we consider a multiprocessor computer, we would have to keep
all other processors from working while some particular processor performs its
action, effectively turning our multiprocessor computer into a uniprocessor
computer. Clearly, this is not very practical, so there exist a series of
techniques that allow for multiple processors to share a single memory on a
given computer, however they are generally outside of the scope of this course.

\marginpar{

``\cyrtext{электронная машина и решения принимала бы быстрее, и просчитывала
намного больше вариантов, и не спешила бы домой в конце рабочего дня}''

Translation: The electronic machine would've made decisions faster, considered
more options, and wouldn't hurry home at the end of the day.

}

It gets to be a pretty tiresome work when the size of $S$ is large, or even
worse, infinite. It is therefore clear that multiple computational units could
do things faster. The real trouble comes along when these computational units
have to use the same tape, but that is outside the scope of this course.

The librarian analogy is pretty lousy, as a librarian that overwrites the
library tapes, is surely to be fired rather promptly. The solution to this
analogy dilemma is to have a range of nonessential tapes that serve as
auxiliaries for the librarian's various operations on essential tapes.

\marginpar{Exercise: XOR swap}

In general, we'd like for our computers, unlike our librarians, to do more than
simply store our data in a neat order. We want for our computers to rearrange,
generate and overwrite data on demand. These, and many more data operations
facilitate our actual goals -- the solution of various real-world problems.
Auxiliary \key{variables}, such as our nonessential tapes, can in this context
be used to store structural information necessary to perform such complex data
manipulations in an efficient manner.

This sequence of steps constitutes and action. Note, that there is no movement
of tapes, just reading and writing, everything else, is done by a combination
of such actions.

\newpage

As a by-product, the programmer can often get carried away with some
non-essential details, rather than concentrate on the problem at hand. Indeed,
being ``so close to bear metal'', the paradigm opens up for marvelous
time-spenders on opposing programming frontiers. On the one hand, the
programmer may have to write a great deal of code to even get the simplest
things done, while on the other hand, the programmer can spend a great deal of
time looking for clever tricks to make some part of the program marginally
faster on some particular architecture.

Blah blah conventional CS problem -- abstraction vs. performance.

Time has shown, that neither is a dominating strategy practise. Any
self-respecting programmer knows that premature optimization is the root of all
evil \cite{knuth-goto}, as any self-respecting manager knows not to measure
programmer productivity by the number of lines written.

\marginpar{Exercise: A good computer scientist would quickly come up with a
scheme for generating good for nothing intermediate code, and get paid for not
doing much work at all.}

The more accurate productivity measure seems to be an evaluation of
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)] \item the class of computations that the program can
evoke, and \item the \key{time-} and \key{resource} \key{requirements} of such
evocations\end{inparaenum}. Hence, the programmer's job becomes the more poetic
-- ``designing a class of computations'', rather than the more mundane --
''writing a program''. In essence, it seems more fruitful for us to be more
concerned with the behaviour of programs, rather than their contruction.

This view may be acceptable so long as we're not reminded that programs often
have to evolve, either due to changes in the program requirements, or due to
bugs in the original implementation. What's more, programs are usually evolved
by programmers other than their original programmers. In order to evolve a
program \emph{efficiently}, the epoch programmers have to be able to put
themselves in the shoes of the original programmers, and understand why the
program was constructed the way that it was.  This allows them to evolve the
program efficiently, rather than having to resort to say, rewriting the program
from scratch\footnote{Sometimes, the only way to efficiently evolve a program
is to write it from scratch.}.

\begin{definition}

Efficient program evolution is an evolution that increases program compliance
with its requirements, while introducing the least possible changes to the
original program, and accomodating possible future program  evolution.

\end{definition}

In essence, as programmers, we're playwriters for two rather distinct audiences
(almost) at the same time: the feebleminded computer that has to evoke the
program, and the generally clever, but sometimes feebleminded programmer that
has to evolve our program. In order to contrast these two audiences, we first
need an abstract understanding of the notorious von Neumann architecture.







\begin{quote}"You have perhaps had a dream much like mine: Wouldn't it be nice
to have a glorious system of complete maps of the world, whereby one could (by
turning dials) increase or decrease the scale at will? A similar thing can be
achieved for programs, rather easily, when we give the programs a hierarchic
structure like those constructed step-wise. It is not hard to imagine a
computing system which displays a program in such a way that, by pressing
an-appropriate button, one can replace the name of a routine by its expansion
on the next level, or conversely."\cite{knuth-review-of-sp}\end{quote}

\emph{Fun fact:} (should come after discussion of representation of data types
with multiple words) The rooms at DIKU have a peculiar numbering system that
has a lot to do with the way addressing happens in a computer. If you've ever
seen DIKU from the outside, you might've noticed that, by design, all the
windows of a building are of equal size and the windows are equally spaced,
creating a rather aesthetic outside look. The ``address'' of a room inside DIKU
consists of 3 parts, building, floor and window. Buildings have number codes,
as do floors. This leads you to the correct hall, as on any floor there is only
one hallway. The last part of the address indicates the window at which the
room begins, numbered from east to west, (0-indexed). The analogy breaks down
when we find out that not all rooms in a given hall are of the same size.
