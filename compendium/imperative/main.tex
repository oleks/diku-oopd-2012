\chapter{Imperative programming}

% outline: (declarative -> imperative -> computer -> action -> action sequence -> action
% cluster) | state -> (time | variables -> types -> aggregates -> structures ->
% value vs. reference)
%
% hmm.. how about control flow structures?

% to be introduced in one chapter:
%
% (declarative), imperative, procedural, and structured programming.
%
% under procedural: subroutines vs. coroutines.
%
% primitive types, arrays, structures, value and reference types.
%
% next chapter: data structures.
%
% material for first week: the first two chapters.

% humans can only remember about 4 things at once -- the registers of the
% librarian -- see short-term memory article on wikipedia.

% what's prohibited by the language vs. what's left up to the programmer.
% Consider for instance implicit state references in imperative programming vs.
% functional programming where all input parameters are specified.
