\begin{definition}

A \key{computer}\footnote{We conventionally use the words ``\key{machine}'' and
``\key{system}'' interchangeably with the word ``computer''.} is an entity with
\key{state} and a series of \key{processors}.  Processors perform \key{actions}
that change the state of the computer.

\end{definition}

While it may be modern (about time) to speak of computers as machines with
multiple processors, we will restrain ourselves to single processor machines.
At times it will provide for an interesting discussion to consider how certain
aspects map over into multiprocessor machines, but in such cases they will be
mentioned explicitly.
