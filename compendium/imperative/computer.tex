\begin{definition}

A \key{computer}\footnotemark is an entity with \key{state} and a series of
\key{processors}.  A processor performs \key{actions} that change the state of
the computer.

\footnotetext{Although at the beginning of the 20th century, a computer was
still a profession, today most computers are electronic machines.  We'll use
the words ``computer'' and ``machine'' interchangably.}

\end{definition}

While it may be modern (about time) to speak of computers as machines with
multiple processors, we will restrain ourselves to single processor machines.
At times it will provide for an interesting discussion to consider how certain
aspects map over into multiprocessor machines, but in such cases they will be
mentioned explicitly.
