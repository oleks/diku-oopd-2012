%\section{Programming paradigms}

\begin{definition}

A \key{programming paradigm} is a technique for writing a certain class of
programs well.

\end{definition}

We will develop the notion of a ``well-written program''
throughout these lecture notes, but initially it suffices to understand
``well'' in the most general sense --- something good, proper, or satisfactory.

A programming language \emph{supports} a programming paradigm, if it
facilitates programming using that paradigm well. The existence and popularity
of a variety of languages and paradigms is considerable empirical evidence that
no language nor paradigm is suitable for all conceivable programs. It is not
uncommon to see programming languages that support multiple paradigms, and
well-written programs that utilize multiple paradigms at once.

The absence of good support for a particular paradigm does not imply the
inapplicability of that paradigm in a particular language.  Paradigms are often
composable; but often at considerable cost to the programmers' time, and the
well-being of programs. As programmers tend to be lazy, yet aesthetic, this
leads to the evolution of programming languages. For instance, one of the
reasons the original creators of the Unix operating system created the C
programming language, was that systems programming in assembly, for a complex
system like Unix, was a rather ``dreary'' task\cite{the-development-of-c}.

% TODO
% A programming language supports a particular paradigm through a
% set of \key{formal rules}. The rules facilitate the use of the paradigm to
% write programs in that language.

% These rules may both facilitate quicker construction of a certain class of
% programs, as well as restrict the programmer in order to guard her from making
% a certain class of logical errors while programming. Hence, a paradigm lets you
% write a certain class of programs more quickly and be more certain in the
% correctness of the programs you write.

% These rules include but are not limited to rules of
% \emph{syntax}, such as how a function should be defined and applied, and rules
% of \emph{semantics}, such as whether a certain function may be applied to
% variables of certain types.

% The syntactic and semantic correctness of the program is often checked
% \key{statically}, i.e. before the program is ever run. In principle, statically
% checked semantics considerably reduce the chances of a certain class of
% programming errors. For instance, you should by now be well-familiar with the
% infamous MoscowML type checker, which didn't let you run a program unless they
% were syntactically well-written and type-checked.
