\section{Problems}

The problems presented in these notes will often take on an algorithmic nature.
Yet, complex problems are not the subject matter of these notes. The idea is
for you to gain an experience with a series of programming paradigms and
techniques, while solving (seemingly) trivial problems.  Hopefully, this will
provide you with a practical toolset, suitable for coping with the (seemingly)
complex problems to come.
