\section*{Problems}

The problems presented in these lecture notes will often take on an algorithmic
nature; however, complex problems are not the subject matter of these lecture
notes. The intent is for you to gain an experience with a series of programming
paradigms and techniques, by solving (seemingly) trivial problems. Hopefully,
this will provide you with a practical toolset, suitable for coping with the
(seemingly) complex problems to come.
