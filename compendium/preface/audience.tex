\section*{Audience}

These lecture notes are intended for a post-introductory programming course. In
particular, for an introductory course in imperative, procedural, structured,
object-oriented, and generic programming. The course should be preceded by an
introductory course with a functional programming language such as SML,
Haskell, or alike.

From a programming point of view, it is assumed that the reader is familiar
with the concepts of functions and data types, in particular, recursive,
higher-order and generic functions and data types. From a mathematical point of
view it is assumed that the student is familiar with basic discrete mathematics
and basic asymptotic analysis.
