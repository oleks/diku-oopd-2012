\section*{Audience}

These lecture notes are intended for a post-introductory programming course; in
particular, an introductory course in imperative, procedural, structured,
incremental, object-oriented, and generic programming. The course should be
preceded by an introductory course taught in a functional programming language
such as SML, Haskell, or alike.

From a programming point of view, it is assumed that the reader is familiar
with the concepts of functions and data types; in particular, recursive,
higher-order, and generic functions and data types. From a mathematical point
of view, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with basic discrete
mathematics and basic asymptotic analysis.
