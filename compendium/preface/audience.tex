\section{Audience}

This work is intended as course material for a post-introductory programming
course. In particular, for an introductory course in imperative, procedural,
structured, object-oriented, and generic programming; preceded by an
introductory course taught in a declarative programming language such as SML,
Haskell, etc.

From a programming point of view, it is assumed that the reader is familiar
with the concepts of functions, data types, recursive functions and data types,
and higher-order function and data types. From a mathematical point of view it
is assumed that the student is familiar with basic discrete mathematics, and in
particular, basic asymptotic analysis.
