\section{Audience}

These lecture notes are intended for a post-introductory programming course. In
particular, for an introductory course in imperative, procedural, structured,
object-oriented, and generic programming. The course should be preceded by an
introductory course with a declarative programming language such as SML,
Haskell, or alike.

From a programming point of view, it is assumed that the reader is familiar
with the concepts of functions, data types, as well as recursive, higher-order
and generic functions and data types. From a mathematical point of view it is
assumed that the student is familiar with basic discrete mathematics and basic
asymptotic analysis.
