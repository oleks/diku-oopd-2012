\section{Operator overloading}\label{section:objects:operator-overloading}

% Prerequisites: interfaces.

% overriding default methods such as equals and hashCode is akin to overloading
% operators, sometimes overriding equals MEANS overloading the == operator!
% However, certain operators may not initially be defined for objects. This is
% checked at compile time. Would be nice if there were attributes that we could
% add that would force a compile-time check instead of the
% "NotImplementedException".

% hashCode should overridden whenever equals is overridden. In particular,
% equal objects should have the same hashCode but objects with the same
% hashCode are not necessarily equal! Similarly, if == is defined, != should
% also be, and same goes for < and >, and subsequently <= and >=.
