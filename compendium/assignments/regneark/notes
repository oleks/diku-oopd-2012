Start with Accelerated C++ like exercises -- introduce modular data representation.

Start with GUI rather early -- enabling for a full-blown excel application by the time of the exam.

- A comprehensive GUI exercise.

- Enabling the plug and play of libraries: a good OO exercise.

- Some nice parsing/evaluation exercises.
  - distinguishing between cells and cell ranges in computations. 

Ideas for exam:
- Implement drawing of various graphs as a plugin.


- Unlike excel, we want both cell and matrix outputs -- we should think
  carefully about how exactly this is to be implemented.

1.

  - Google Go

  - Input/output

  - Input: one dimensional table where each row is either an integer value or a
    command. Plug-n-play commands, such as SUM, AVG, etc. At least, it should
    be easy to add new commands.

  - Various selection methods: single cell or arrays at a time.

  - All commands refer only cells above them, so a top-down execution is fine.

  - There are no nested commands, so the syntax is =<command> <index> <index>

  - Output: static values, where SUM, AVG, etc. have been computed.

  - It is OK to have the entire output in memory for quick access in commands.

Perhaps, this part is best left to the next exercise:

  - This seems almost too easy.. yet impossible to do pretty without
    interfaces. The complication to make this a full blown exercise is DAG
    analysis. The necessity of interfaces can be mitigated by the fact that we will
    be changing previous codebase anyhow. So do it without to begin with.


1.

Perhaps the first assignment should simply be on reporting using ASCII.

Input: csv
Output: pretty ascii table, bar char, histogram.
