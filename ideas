Introduce stacks, show an interface (in this case an object fulfills the
interface if it implements the certain list of methods), show an
implementation, talk about time and space complexity.

Introduce queues (and deques), show an interface, discuss implementation
techniques, leave actual implementation up to the reader, where submission is
graded automatically to include: valid interface implementation (as in
unit-test tested), perhaps well-named, containing annotation of time and space
complexity. Half grade (or so) is passing the automatic check, half grade is
given by instructor, checking the validity of the time and space complexity
estimates, coding and commenting style in general.
